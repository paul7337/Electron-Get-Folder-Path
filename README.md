### Setup
You'll need to have basic electron setup. Information on that can be found <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app">here</a>

Then just switch out the main and index files, and it should run ok.

## OR
If you already have node installed globally, you should be able to just run command:
npm install
Then to run it:
npm start
